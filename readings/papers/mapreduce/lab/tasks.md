- [ ] workers talk to master via RPC
- [ ] worker process ask master for a task
- [ ] worker process reads the task's input from one or more files
- [ ] worker executes the task
- [ ] worker writes the task's output to one or more files
- [ ] master detects if a worker has not completed its task within a timeout period
- [ ] master hands timed out task to a different worker

- My guess is that a worker runs on a goroutine (thread). In this lab, Goroutines == workers
- what is a master and what does a master do? Meaning, what is the behavior of the master?
  - what functions does the master call?
  - what shared resources does the master have to keep track of?
  - what does the master return?
- The worker should put intermediate Map output in files in the current directory, where your worker can later read them as input to Reduce tasks.
